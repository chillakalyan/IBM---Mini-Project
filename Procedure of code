# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to predict diabetes based on various health metrics. The steps involve loading and understanding the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing the data, selecting features, building a model, and evaluating its performance.

## Steps

### Step 1: Understand the Data
- **Load the dataset** (`diabetes_data.csv`) and inspect its structure.
- **Identify features** (e.g., age, glucose levels, BMI) and target variable (e.g., diabetes diagnosis: 0 or 1).
- **Check for missing or inconsistent data**.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the data with plots (e.g., histograms, box plots, pair plots).
- Look for correlations between features and the target variable.
- Identify any potential outliers or anomalies.

### Step 3: Preprocessing
- **Handle missing values** (e.g., imputation techniques).
- **Normalize or scale numerical features**.
- **Encode categorical variables** (if any) using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- **Split the data** into training and testing sets.

### Step 4: Feature Selection
- Use techniques like correlation analysis, mutual information, or tree-based methods to select the most relevant features.

### Step 5: Model Selection
- Choose algorithms suitable for classification, such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
  - Neural Networks (if data size allows)
- Start with a simple model, then progress to more complex ones.

### Step 6: Model Evaluation
- Use metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC
- Perform **cross-validation** for robust evaluation.

### Step 7: Model Optimization
- Fine-tune hyperparameters using **grid search** or **random search**.
- Avoid overfitting by using **regularization techniques** or **early stopping**.
